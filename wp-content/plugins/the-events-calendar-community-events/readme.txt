== Documentation ==

Community Events extends the functionality of Modern Tribe's The Events Calendar (http://m.tri.be/3j) to allow for frontend event submission on your WordPress site. With pretty permalinks enabled, the frontend fields are accessible at the following URLs:

Events list: /events/community/list/
Specific page in events list: /events/community/list/page/[num]
Add a new event: /events/community/add/
Edit an already-submitted event: /events/community/edit/[id] ( redirects to /events/community/list/[post-type]/id )
Delete an already-submitted event: /events/community/delete/[id]

Where /events/ is the TEC slug defined on the main settings tab, and /community/ is the CE slug defined on the Community settings tab (e.g. you can tweak the first 2 parts of the URL).

= Shortcodes =

Shortcodes are only available for users who have permalinks turned off; this method will NOT work if you're running with a pretty permalinks structure. These will only work on pages, so don't try them in posts/events/widgets/etc.

Shortcode information

Create a page and use the following:

[tribe_community_events_title] as title
[tribe_community_events] in content

You can add this page to the menu.
